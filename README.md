Please open this project with IntelliJ IDEA 14 Community Edition

This project tries to show how to unit test a piece of concurrency code. This is a "try" and doesn't mean unit test is a good place to test concurrency code. I originally thought unit test can't test concurrency. But via this example code, this may not be the case.

Two concurrency tests are implemented in the way of manual mocking and mockito. The test file is called MediaRefresherConcurrencyTest under test folder.

Any feedback is welcomed.
